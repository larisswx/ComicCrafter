# ComicCrafter

**Your AI-Powered Comic Book Architect**

## üìñ Vision

ComicCrafter is an innovative, web-based platform that empowers creators of all skill levels to transform text scripts into visually rich, multi-page comic books. It bridges the gap between storytelling and art creation by leveraging cutting-edge AI, eliminating the need for traditional drawing skills and dramatically accelerating the production workflow. Our vision is to democratize comic creation, allowing anyone with a story to tell to bring their universe to life with consistent characters, dynamic layouts, and professional-quality artwork.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **AI-Powered Art Generation**: Utilizes Google's Gemini and Imagen models to generate stunning character art and panel illustrations from simple text prompts.
- **Consistent Character Creation**: The "Character Architect" generates a character reference sheet, ensuring your characters maintain a consistent appearance across different panels, poses, and expressions.
- **Multi-Project & Page Management**: Create and manage multiple, distinct comic book projects. Each project can contain multiple pages, with all progress automatically saved to your browser's local storage.
- **Dynamic Panel Scripting**: A flexible "Panel Scripter" allows you to add multiple dialogue bubbles, narration boxes, and sound effect (SFX) text items to any panel.
- **Multi-Image Layering**: Go beyond single images. Add multiple image layers to a single panel to create complex, composite scenes with foreground and background elements.
- **Customizable Page Layouts**: Take full control of your page composition with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface to rearrange panels and a selection of predefined layout templates (e.g., Hero Panel, 2x2 Grid).
- **Full Project Export**: Export your work in industry-standard formats. Download a single page as a high-resolution PNG, or export the entire comic book as a multi-page PDF or a CBZ archive, ready for digital comic readers.
